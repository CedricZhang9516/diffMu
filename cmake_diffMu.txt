From your G4 work directory:

1. tar -xzvf diffMu.tgz, to extract diffMu directory from diffMu.tgz
2. mkdir diffMu-build, so you now have diffMu and diffMu-build directories
3. cd diffMu-build
4. cmake -DGeant4_DIR=$G4LIB ../diffMu 2>&1 |tee cmake.log
5. make 2>&1 |tee make.log , or
   make , or add -jN option for multithreading.
6. ./diffMu -n 1000 2>&1 |tee diffMu.log , to run 1000 events, or
   ./diffMu , to use visualization
